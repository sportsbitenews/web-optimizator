## Important notes ##

  * If you will experience any problems during installation, please refer to [Troubleshooting and Support](TroubleshootingAndSupport.md) section.
  * If you are using PHP Speedy or Web Optimizer, deactivate or delete them before WEBO Site SpeedUp installation. They are not compatible with WEBO Site SpeedUp.
  * If you are using any other DLE performance-related modules, consider disabling them during installing and testing of WEBO Site SpeedUp. Such modules may affect WEBO Site SpeedUp operation. And note that WEBO Site SpeedUp integrates and totally exceeds functionality of many such modules. Just check out the WEBO Site SpeedUp [feature list](http://http://www.webogroup.com/home/site-speedup/features/).

## Installing ##

  1. Download from the [official site](http://www.webogroup.com/home/download/) the latest version of the package WEBO Site SpeedUp for DLE that should look like `webo.site.speedup.vx.x.x.dle.zip` (where X are version numbers). Package file should be few Kb in size.
  1. Extract this package to the `/engine/inc/` directory of DLE installation to have the following structure there:
```
LICENSE.txt
readme.txt
webositespeedup.php
webositespeedup.png
```
  1. Make directory `/engine/inc/` writable for your web server (or for all users) - WEBO Site SpeedUp will install here core package automatically.
  1. In DLE admin panel open the page `?mod=webositespeedup`. WEBO Site SpeedUp will download its core package from repository, analyze the system environment and setup the initial configuration.

```
/web-optimizer/
|__/cache/
|__/controller/
|__ ...
