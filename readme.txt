Web Optimizer
------------

Web Optimizer is a PHP script that automatically speeds up your website by combining and compressing your JavaScript and CSS assets.
It can also GZIP these assets, and the page itself (via PHP or .htaccess options). Also it applies CSS Sprites and data:URI techniques.
Also it supports unobtrusive JavaScript conversion and a lot of other useful options.
Web Optimizer is initially based on PHP Speedy.
