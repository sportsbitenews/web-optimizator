# Understanding WEBO Site SpeedUp #

The most effective optimization requires better understanding of all optimization techniques and principles.

WEBO Site SpeedUp works as a very light proxy for your PHP website — it buffers all output content (or just gets it through CMS API), applies all possible optimizations, and gives accelerated HTML to your end-users. All actions are tested and verified through tough performance standards so overall server load won’t increase. Moreover by implementing caching techniques WEBO Site SpeedUp can reduce CPU computations intensity and increase your web server margin of safety. Two schemes below shows website operation cycle without WEBO Site SpeedUp and with WEBO Site SpeedUp respectively.
